Todo - 

	Validation on new Tweets and DM's

	CORS Issues - http://blog.ionic.io/handling-cors-issues-in-ionic/
	No live server because of this
	"This application is not allowed to access or delete your direct messages."

	Had to edit cordova-oauth to switch from oauth/authenticate to oauth/authorize

	Authentication errors due to malformed requests
