Using:

Ionic
AngularJS
ngCordova
jsSHA
ngTwitter - Probably won't be able to use ngTwitter due to lack of DM's.

Bower?

Change:

Callback URL to own redirect (must end up at http://localhost/callback)
Look into securing the private application key - use Firebase?

Notes:

Manually removed ngCordova's oAuth plugin, included ngCordovaOauth manually
